# Machine Learning Full Course Notes + Quizes
 - This is my quick look at the Machine Learning Course. The course is available from Coursera
[The Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

# Caveat Emptor

- Solutions to quizes are based on my own approach but I continually researched in the forum for the things I didn't quite do well.
- Try fast!But if you are spending more than 30mins, get help.

# My Journey

- Before Coursera, I had made some tremendous research. I am currently working in a company where I am supposed to apply Edge ML Skills, so looking at Coursera was i essence to refresh a few basics before making my next huge moves.
